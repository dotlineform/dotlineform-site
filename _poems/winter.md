<pre class="poem-text">
before you know it
years will pass
 
and all the daily decisions
that seem so important at the time
will be forgotten
 
we’ll see that ‘living in the present’
was like watching grains of salt
 
as they melt and then crystallise
only to dissolve again
 
cold has arrived
many winter months ahead
 
the sunlight is so beautiful even when grey
it never stops, even in the darkest nights
 
all the flowers and animals are prepared
as is in their nature

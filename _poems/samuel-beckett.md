<pre class="poem-text">
I had a dream a few years ago. It sticks to me, like a strange glue.
 
It was real, as real as dreams get. Not just a dream, but as if, it was real, whilst obviously being a dream.
 
The dream is quite simple
 
I’m walking down Milsom Street in Bath, it’s a nice day.
 
I’m walking down the street and i pass by an old bloke who, for the life of me, looks like Samuel Beckett.
 
I know he’s not Samuel Beckett, because he just died the other day. As we passed, I say
 
“what are you doing here?”
 
and he says
 
“I have unfinished business’
 
we smile, and go on our ways.
 
reflecting, I wonder why I never looked back to see where he was going.

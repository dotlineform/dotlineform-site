<pre class="poem-text">
after the dream I’m distracted, scanning crowds
strange perspective of a dream is similar to how we feel when passing strangers in the street
however spacially close, there is an unknown distance between us
hoping to recognise her before I forget her face
in dream words melt
as does separation
closeness and distance, they melt like wax with each repetition of simple scenes
repeating, uncovering the smallest detail, again and again
to make the slightest thing more elegant, more precise?
(hoping for the tiny detail that will explain it all)
 
clarity is momentary
what does she say? where do thoughts come from and go to?
I think she knows something,
but her thoughts are like wishes also
(perhaps she is dreaming too, our dreams are briefly overlapping like translucent sheets)

we make ghosts
a wall being built with every thought
even dream thoughts
 
in this space behind closed eyes
I recall it all like I would remember taking a photograph
a strange feeling
I felt absolutely certain, momentarily
but for now all that has substance are these words
which soon will be all that is left of our meeting and glances

is Selina’s face a construct, a composite? where did her black dress and eyes come from?
I heard her speaking to me but can’t describe the sounds nor remember the words
words without structure or content but containing a message nonetheless
an implication
walking along a street
a door opens
(she is opening the door from the inside)
 
and then it ends

<pre class="poem-text">
i don’t draw lines without any reason
and that is what I tried to describe to you
 
the fundamental relationship between loneliness and longing and art
searching and reaching for Plato’s Forms
 
is not really about actually finding them
just simply trying to communicate that when we look for purity
 
we are really only looking for love
(or really just the shared experience of exploring)
 
love is not a thing, it can’t be made in a factory
it’s the sharing of special moments
 
it’s creating such moments, as if out of nothing
emptiness is the source and we are the vessel
 
(so very easily
we didn’t care about anything apart from the beautiful joy of creating lovely funny moments)
 
i will find art when it is needed
i trust my soul to say when
 
I don’t worry about not finding it again
its always there under the skin
 
hidden protected jewel
and given away to friends who will keep it warm
 
even when the artifacts are lost or decay
because it’s always always about the moment
 
beautiful curves
a whole world of memories in a single droplet

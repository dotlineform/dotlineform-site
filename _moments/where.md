title: where?

<pre class="poem-text">
where are we from?
our particles are from stars
all the basic components
enough to make a rock
or even a plant
we could trace the history of our particles
to the beginning of time
I’m sure some of them
have travelled further than we could ever comprehend
 
the question still remains…
 
and now we are here
(carrying our bodies, particles, without thinking)
 
there is something else
 
this feeling of love
and all our emotions
they are not the same as our cells, our atoms
they’re not explained by mathematics
so where do they come from?
 
where?

<pre class="poem-text">
what do we choose?
we turn life into a dream, an ideal
what is that dream, a mesh
 
a tiny spider builds a web
without knowing where that web is spun
it might be in a fragile place
 
we see beauty in structures
paintings and artifacts
where is beauty when all that is gone?
 
music holds keys
rhythms and freedom
beating hearts
 
we are from Africa
not shining temples in the heavens
which are symbols of loss
 
what are we to do?
do you not see it?
we want to embrace it all and each other
 
worlds within worlds
words within words
and there are so many of them
 
my soul speaks through kisses
if it has a taste, it tastes of lips
gentle seemless sublime
 
there is no other way
than the way we are
dancing across fault lines

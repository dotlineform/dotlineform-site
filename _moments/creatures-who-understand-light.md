<pre class="poem-text">
(perhaps somewhere…)
 
there are creatures who understand light
 
it streams up from their heads
 
as if their minds are the mist and the mist is their thoughts
 
and where their hands might be
 
is a beautiful waterfall of light
 
and their bodies don’t have legs
 
they simply glide like clouds
 
these creatures don’t have hearts
 
because their whole bodies are infused with love
 
and they touch each other
 
with sleepy breaths
 
their kisses are slower than the drift of mountains
 
embraces curved in marble
 
we feel their gentle ripples

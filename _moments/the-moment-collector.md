<pre class="poem-text">
deep in a warm cellar
many steps below
where it’s quiet enough to hear dust settle
lit only by particles that form from emptiness
 
I carefully put the last moment
into a small vessel
whose antiquity predates this room
and most probably the universe
 
i would like to describe this vessel for you
it’s simple and scarred
it embraces form
 
it will keep the moment safe
for eternity, however long that might be
 
my friend the clock maker would know
but he has been quiet for a long time
and i don’t want to disturb him whilst he works
 
i gently put the jar on a shelf
next to all the others
 
the light dims…
yes, it is time to go
i slowly wish all the moments peace
and they fall asleep
knowing that i will never forget them

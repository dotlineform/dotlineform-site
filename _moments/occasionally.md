<pre class="poem-text">
occasionally I find myself
thinking about loss
it’s a strange feeling, preparing for moments that are inevitable
 
i almost imagine the numbness
it’s like hardening molten metal in a furnace
moments on the verge of collapse
 
life is so short
but would it be different if it was longer?
 
if we were a piece of string
coiled up
 
would we see ourselves unfold?
into a straight line, with a beginning and an end?
 
or are we really a knot
never to be untied
 
always blissfully unaware
of how we started
 
and where the end might be

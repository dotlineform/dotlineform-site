<pre class="poem-text">
snow is pure my love
but it’s frozen when it reaches us
 
our warmth is impure
but our love is from a warm place
 
purity exists
but it’s an emptiness
 
our feelings are real
 
~
 
thank you for showing me
how lovely it is
to aspire
to being like an angel
 
it’s you that’s the angel
my simple mission
is only to help you understand
this simple truth
 
and in the process
I fall in love, a peaceful falling
a misty dream of strange floating symbols
and smiles and green eyes
 
~
 
happiness is an embrace
a smile from a stranger
a tune playing in a shop
“if I saw you on the street,
would I have you in my dreams tonight?”
 
happiness is being awake at night
and writing about the heart
and all the uncountable moments
that flow with us
 
happiness is about closeness
happiness is sharing warmth
hhappiness is having strength
 
even when I feel I’m falling apart
I will always believe in happiness
 
~
 
don’t doubt my love for you
don’t doubt who i love
don’t doubt love
don’t doubt
 
accept moments of unconditional love
accept moments of love
accept moments
 
love can’t be made, bought nor sold
it just happens
because it’s in the air
and even if we just catch it briefly
breathe in, breathe in
 
~
 
if we only see light
how can we help people in darkness
 
to see inside
to see where there is no light
 
~
 
i remember as we were walking through the woods
i kept on taking photos on my phone of the ground
and you probably wondered what i was seeing
a luminous green sweet dropped in the snow,
a leaf that makes me think of your lips,
tiny bits of trees that form beautiful lines
snow covers and uncovers
curves and symbols everywhere

<pre class="poem-text">
it is very quiet
a stillness that is only possible when all around are sleeping
 
the night allows lights to unhide themselves
some are close, others are very far away
 
there is just this, perhaps there is nothing more
beyond things that are visible
 
and things that are hidden
</pre>

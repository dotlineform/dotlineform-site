<pre class="poem-text">
boundary condition
in this room
there are walls, a floor, a roof
 
i describe this because there is nothing else to describe
with any certainty
 
my diary contains nothing of importance
i watch things dissolve
no longer wondering why they do so
 
doll is sleeping
far away from this world
inside this world
 
a boundary condition is one where
past future and present are escaped
outside of time
 
stillness and separation

<pre class="poem-text">
this picture is before the heron
but he is here still
because this is his home
 
where is the heron going
an arrow across the surface
leaving no ripples
 
his wings are beating like sun beams
in harmony with all around
gliding through moments
 
i’m walking along the river
and my moments are like dust
falling through an hourglass
 
i gaze in wonder at the heron
i try to slow my thoughts so i can really see him
but he’s already passed by
 
beautiful moments
where we feel connected

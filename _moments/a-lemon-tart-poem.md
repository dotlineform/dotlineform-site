<pre class="poem-text">
light falls down from above
the above that is known
(and the above that will always be mysterious, mystical)
 
it falls on grey water
and may even reach the depths
where creatures live
 
we sit for a long time here
not thinking just sitting
feeling love and comfort
 
just being here, with the sounds of the birds and the water ripples
watching the light fall from unknowable to unknown
 
our wine is almost going to sleep
it’s time to go inside
let’s leave the sky and the sea to embrace
 
our bellies full and happy
everything in peace
 
but then something happens
 
beyond comprehension
beyond words

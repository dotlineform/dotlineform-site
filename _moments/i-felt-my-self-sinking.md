<pre class="poem-text">
I felt my self sinking
but I’m on solid ground, as far as I can tell
 
so it must be the world that’s sinking
(is there a difference?)
 
not alone, because the tree will be there for me (and I for her)
should i return
(it’s not that far away)
 
what matters is that I sink with the world
the ground and the sky
 
and in peace we sink together

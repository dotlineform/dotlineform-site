<pre class="poem-text">
keep me close to you honey
let me know what’s going on
tell me things without me asking
 
hold me caress me
wrap yourself around me
breathe with me
just tell me what you’re feeling
 
we all have our journeys
some are secret, hidden to all
(perhaps even to ourselves)
 
the special moments are those we share
and every moment is so important
all are connected
 
I’m feeling that I don’t want to chase shadows
I feel alone but this feeling has been with me for a long time, almost forever
I just want some peace of mind

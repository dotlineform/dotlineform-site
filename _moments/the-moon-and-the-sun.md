<pre class="poem-text">
what i was trying to say
 
was about doubt
 
i only see clearly when the moon is out
 
my thoughts become clear in the night
 
and everyone is sleeping
 
all the people, all the birds, all the little animals
 
mouse too, is sleeping
 
in his litle bed of straw under the stairs
 
sleep well, my heart is with you all
 
you are alive when the sun shines
 
but just know
 
i only see the moon
 
because the sun shines on it

<pre class="poem-text">
There is a form
it exists in a field of immeasurable emptiness
which is its friend
it has no idea of its size
it could be the size of an atom
it could be our size
or the size of a galaxy
it just knows that the emptiness extends forever
and so it is in peace
 
There are 4 forms
they sense each other’s existence
or extrapolate from each of their own equally vast mathematical theories
but they know that they will never meet
the distances are beyond comprehension
and so they drift in this immeasurable emptiness
 
There are 3 forms
they ride the gentle currents near the bottom
of this immeasurably deep ocean
they sense that there are others like them
and this gives them comfort
and brings them happy dreams
 
There are 2 forms
they may have been, a long time ago
a single idea
but they have no memory of that
even by their own standards of measuring time
(which are immeasurably more capable than our own)
the beginning of the universe was too long ago to comprehend
 
But they feel  
a feeling that there is something in the vast emptiness between them
that will heal them

I’m usually good with words
but sometimes I’m lost for words
like today, I’m lost for words
 
any words I write tonight will be just words
and all the emotions and feelings
will have no release, they’ll stay hidden
 
because words have limits
they can be translated, and we have to deal with the subsequent loss
it’s true, some feelings can’t be expressed in words
 
i think that’s what I’m really writing about
in all my little poems, here
 
when i write, all i’m trying to do is explain
how i feel, in an abstract way
 
i don’t abstract to be awkward
 
i want the words to describe not just how i’m feeling
but reach out
and be words that mean something to everyone
 
I wish for simple little healing words

<pre class="poem-text">
her smile is a heart
and everyone who knows her feels it
 
when she is sleeping eyes closed
and I can feel her warm breath
 
her lips naturally relax into a smile
that makes me feel so at peace and in love
 
and I feel her beautiful heart
with every embrace
 
she couldn’t possibly know
(like the sun doesn’t know)
 
how it’s warmth keeps us alive

<pre class="poem-text">
perhaps it is an alchemical truth
that the sky is always blue
but most of the time purity is hidden from us
 
and then when we find the blue
it is only gas molecules scattering the sun
the atmosphere thins to a layer
beyond which there is only emptiness
 
which is not really empty
no matter how far you look or travel
there is no emptiness to be found

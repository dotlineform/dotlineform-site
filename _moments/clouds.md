<pre class="poem-text">
I realise that it’s just a photo of clouds
 
and they are just tiny bits of dust and water particles
 
but they mean something to me
 
i see shapes and forms
 
i see our lives in these clouds
 
i see loneliness and togetherness in them
 
everything
 
our hopes and wishes, our emotions
 
all in these little clouds

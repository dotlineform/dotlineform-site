<pre class="poem-text">
an
unrealisable
feeling
of
free
will
that
stretches
for
hours
and
years
before
being
crushed
under
its
own
weight
of
expectation
which
it
had
failed
to
properly
understand
and
so
consequently
was
unprepared
for
when
a
previously
unknowable
influence
appeared
as
an
uncertainty
that
i
found
impossible
to
reconcile
leading
to
a
condition
of
exponentially
increasing
doubt
that
ultimately
made
the
whole
concept
meaningless
resulting
in
an
unresolvable
feeling
of
free
will
that
may
possibly
last
forever

<pre class="poem-text">
flowers and stems
feel no regret as they die
and sink into the water from where they came

their memories are molecules 
blending with the air
and our love

so of all their moments 
which ones mean the most?
none of them, all of them

photographs are always in motion 
no thing is ever still
even memories

as they fade they emerge
like constantly hatching eggs
layers upon layers

we are always stepping over broken egg shells 
no one is the same as preceding 

in this way, we slowly understand 
whilst time always moves into the future 

past moments constantly flow
shaping the present 
the past is alive

a lotus flowers
floats in the water
(it becomes the water)

a small insect
smaller than the eye can see
is born and dies

and is born again

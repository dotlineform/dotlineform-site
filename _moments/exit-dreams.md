<pre class="poem-text">
when it is dark however, before i check the clock to see whether it is 2am or 3am or some awkward time, i know that there is nothing else, anywhere, and that is when i am confronted by the quickly fading radiation of a recent dream, and that i might without control fall back again into it, or simply re-awake again later and this moment will be forgotten.

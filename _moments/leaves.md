<pre class="poem-text">
leaves float on silky stems
flowers float just above the ground
light infuses everything
 
is love really like this?
does it sometimes feel like nature
limitless and free
 
or does it constrict
by circumstance and rules
our paths, like a twisting thread
 
is it possible to unravel
the curls of our thoughts
and what will happen if we do?
 
will i dissolve into wine
and be reborn a grape
soaking up the sun?
 
in a field somewhere
in peace with all the creatures
all the mice and the birds

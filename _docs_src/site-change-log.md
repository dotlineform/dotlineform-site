# Site Change Log

## [2026-04-01] Extended removed-row cleanup to local staged and derivative media

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
`build_catalogue.py` now removes stale local media outputs under `DOTLINEFORM_MEDIA_BASE_DIR` when workbook rows are removed.

**Reason:**  
Cleaning only repo-owned route stubs and JSON still left stale staged inputs, srcset outputs, and staged downloads on the local media side. Those files are owned by the same catalogue pipeline and should be cleaned by the same removed-row pass.

**Effect:**  
Removed work, work-detail, and moment rows now also delete matching files from the local `make_srcset_images` input folders, the generated `primary/` and `thumb/` srcset folders, and staged work downloads under `works/files/`. Aggregate catalogue JSON and search rebuilds still run afterward from the current workbook state.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_catalogue.py`
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)

**Notes:**  
This still does not touch canonical source media under `DOTLINEFORM_PROJECTS_BASE_DIR` or remote media such as R2.

## [2026-04-01] Added removed-row stale-artifact cleanup to build_catalogue

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
`build_catalogue.py` now cleans up repo-owned generated artifacts when workbook rows are removed, instead of only warning that stale files may remain.

**Reason:**  
The planner already knew which workbook rows had disappeared. Turning that into concrete cleanup reduces drift in route stubs, per-record JSON, and Studio assignment data without requiring a separate manual delete pass for the common cases.

**Effect:**  
Removed work, work-detail, series, and moment rows now trigger deletion of the matching generated route stubs and per-record JSON files in the repo. The same pass also prunes removed series rows and removed per-work overrides from `assets/studio/data/tag_assignments.json`, then rebuilds aggregate indexes and catalogue search from the current workbook state.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_catalogue.py`
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)
- [Studio Scope](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=data-models-studio)

**Notes:**  
This first slice only cleans repo-owned generated artifacts and Studio assignment rows. External source media and derivative media cleanup still remain separate.

## [2026-04-01] Added explicit planner version metadata to build_catalogue state

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
`build_catalogue.py` now writes `var/build_catalogue_state.json` with explicit top-level planner metadata so planner-state evolution is easier to reason about.

**Reason:**  
The planner state had already become important enough to deserve a clearer contract. Explicit versioning and a migration note make future planner changes easier to document and safer to evolve without turning state resets into the default workflow.

**Effect:**  
Planner state now includes `schema`, `planner_version`, and `migration_note`. Older compatible state files are still accepted, normalized in memory, and rewritten on the next successful write run.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_catalogue.py`
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)

**Notes:**  
This does not change canonical site data. It only makes the local planner-state contract more explicit.

## [2026-04-01] Added a curator-facing Studio build activity feed

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** studio

**Summary:**  
Added a curated build-activity journal and a Studio page at `/studio/build-activity/` so recent catalogue build runs can be reviewed without reading raw script logs.

**Reason:**  
The catalogue planner now has enough context to explain what changed and what it rebuilt. A lightweight recent-activity surface makes that information useful to the curator and creates a cleaner base for any later public “recent updates” work.

**Effect:**  
Successful non-dry-run `build_catalogue.py` runs now append a local journal under `var/build_activity/`, regenerate `assets/studio/data/build_activity.json`, and the new Studio page renders the latest entries with changed workbook/media groups plus action summaries.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_activity.py`
- `scripts/build_catalogue.py`
- `assets/studio/data/studio_config.json`
- `assets/studio/js/studio-config.js`
- `assets/studio/js/build-activity.js`
- `studio/build-activity/index.md`
- [Build Activity](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=build-activity)
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)

**Notes:**  
This feed is a local Studio summary surface, not the canonical low-level script log and not yet a public site history feed.

## [2026-04-01] Made work prose optional in catalogue generation

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
`generate_work_pages.py` no longer treats missing work prose mappings or missing work prose source files as a reason to skip work page or work JSON generation.

**Reason:**  
Work prose files are intentionally rare in this repo. Missing prose should show up as absent page prose on the site, not block unrelated metadata, routing, or JSON refresh.

**Effect:**  
`_works/<work_id>.md` stubs and `assets/works/index/<work_id>.json` now continue to generate when `Works.work_prose_file` is empty, unresolved, or points at a missing file. In those cases the work payload is written without prose content rather than emitting a per-work warning and skipping the record.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/generate_work_pages.py`
- [Generate Work Pages](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-generate-work-pages)
- [Catalogue Scope](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=data-models-catalogue)

**Notes:**  
This changes only the work-prose boundary. Series and moment prose handling still follows their existing rules.

## [2026-04-01] Fixed moments index rebuild on scoped non-moment runs

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
Fixed a local-variable scoping bug in `generate_work_pages.py` that could crash scoped runs such as `--work-ids ...` when the script still rebuilt the global moments index JSON afterward.

**Reason:**  
The moments index rebuild path is meant to remain available even when moment page generation is not selected, but it was reusing column helper variables that were only initialized inside the moment-page branch.

**Effect:**  
Scoped work-only runs now complete normally while still allowing the global moments index pass to evaluate its inputs and write-skip correctly.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/generate_work_pages.py`
- [Generate Work Pages](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-generate-work-pages)

## [2026-04-01] Added workbook-aware planning to the catalogue pipeline entrypoint

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
`build_catalogue.py` now plans workbook-backed generation before it runs, using a persisted planner state file to infer affected work IDs, series IDs, and moment IDs instead of requiring those scopes to be supplied manually most of the time.

**Reason:**  
The previous pipeline wrapper still depended on the user to translate workbook edits into `--mode`, `--work-ids`, `--series-ids`, and `--moment-ids`. That made safe incremental rebuilds harder to reason about and kept future pipeline enhancements tightly coupled to manual operator knowledge.

**Effect:**  
Default `./scripts/build_catalogue.py` runs now compare workbook-backed source records against `var/build_catalogue_state.json`, print an execution plan, skip generate/search when nothing relevant changed, and persist the new planner state after successful write runs. Copy/srcset stages remain draft-driven for now, so published media-only changes still need explicit flags.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_catalogue.py`
- `.gitignore`
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)
- [Pipeline Use Cases](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=pipeline-use-cases)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)

**Notes:**  
This was the first planner slice. Removed-row stale-artifact cleanup was added in a later follow-up on the same day.

## [2026-04-01] Extended catalogue planning to track canonical source media

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** scripts

**Summary:**  
`build_catalogue.py` now fingerprints canonical source images for works, work details, and moments in addition to workbook-backed rows, so published media replacements can be picked up without manual ID scoping.

**Reason:**  
Workbook-only planning was enough for metadata changes, but it still left source-image edits outside the default build path. That kept routine image replacement work dependent on user-supplied flags and IDs.

**Effect:**  
The planner state now includes source-media fingerprints and can infer copy/srcset plus downstream generation scope from file changes. Existing planner state files that predate media tracking are treated as a baseline until the next write run updates them.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_catalogue.py`
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)
- [Pipeline Use Cases](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=pipeline-use-cases)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)

## [2026-03-30] Removed the docs compatibility mirror and legacy Studio doc-link fallback

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Removed the flat Studio docs compatibility output and retired the old legacy-link fallback from the docs builder so the published docs data contract is now scope-owned only.

**Reason:**  
The repo now uses explicit scope-owned viewer routes and scoped docs JSON outputs. Keeping the old mirror and legacy path rewrite added dormant complexity without protecting any core site functionality.

**Effect:**  
The docs builder now writes only `assets/data/docs/scopes/studio/` and `assets/data/docs/scopes/library/`, legacy `/docs/.../` path rewriting is gone, Studio source-doc links now use `/docs/?scope=studio&doc=...`, and the shared docs viewer normalizes incoming Studio viewer URLs onto the scoped route.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_docs.rb`
- `assets/js/docs-viewer.js`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `studio/index.md`
- [Docs Viewer Builder](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-docs-builder)

## [2026-03-30] Documented when the shared docs viewer runtime should and should not fork

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Added a dedicated site-architecture note describing the current boundary between scope-specific docs route shells and the shared docs viewer runtime, including concrete examples of changes that should remain shell-level and the kinds of divergence that would justify a runtime fork later.

**Reason:**  
The docs system now serves both Studio and library scopes through one viewer runtime. The repo needed an explicit guardrail so future scope-specific changes can be evaluated against a stable “do not fork unless the product model changes” rule.

**Effect:**  
There is now a stable reference for deciding whether a new docs requirement belongs in route-shell composition, scope-owned data, a small shared option, or a true runtime split.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- [Docs Viewer Runtime Boundary](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=docs-viewer-runtime-boundary)
- [Architecture](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=architecture)
- [Docs Viewer Builder](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-docs-builder)

**Notes:**  
The current recommendation remains to keep one docs viewer runtime and allow route-level shells to diverge as needed.

## [2026-03-30] Split the scripts reference into a high-level overview and child docs

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** documentation

**Summary:**  
Reduced the old scripts overview into the current [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts) navigation page and moved command-level script usage into dedicated child documents.

**Reason:**  
The single overview page had accumulated too much detailed operational content to remain useful as a quick architectural entry point.

**Effect:**  
The scripts docs are now easier to scan at the top level, while script-specific flags, outputs, and workflow notes have stable dedicated docs such as [Docs Viewer Builder](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-docs-builder), [Generate Work Pages](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-generate-work-pages), and [Tag Write Server](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-tag-write-server).

**Affected files/docs:**  
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)
- [Docs Viewer Builder](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-docs-builder)
- [Build Catalogue](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-main-pipeline)
- [Generate Work Pages](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-generate-work-pages)
- [Tag Write Server](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts-tag-write-server)
- `AGENTS.md`

**Notes:**  
Script-specific documentation should now be added to the relevant `scripts-*.md` child doc rather than expanding the overview again.

## [2026-03-30] Added config-backed docs media tokens for remote images

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Extended the docs-data builder so docs bodies can use `[[media:...]]` tokens that resolve against `_config.yml` `media_base` before Markdown rendering.

**Reason:**  
Library docs need to support remotely hosted full-size images without hardcoding the full media origin in every document and without storing full-size docs images in the repo.

**Effect:**  
Docs can now stay as ordinary `.md` source files while embedding raw HTML and config-backed remote media URLs, keeping the repo aligned with the “repo holds text and thumbnails, R2 holds full media” principle.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_docs.rb`
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)

**Notes:**  
This change does not add native `.html` source ingestion. The intended authoring model remains `.md` files with YAML front matter, optionally containing raw HTML bodies.

## [2026-03-30] Made the docs library scope-aware and added a separate library docs route

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Refactored the docs viewer data/build contract to support separate `studio` and `library` docs scopes, kept `/docs/` as the Studio docs route, and converted `/library/` from a stub page into a library-scoped docs viewer.

**Reason:**  
The existing docs system implicitly belonged to the Studio domain even though the code and data layout were still flat. Additional docs domains needed scope-owned routes and artifacts before library content could grow cleanly.

**Effect:**  
Studio docs now build into a scope-owned output tree under `assets/data/docs/scopes/studio/`, library docs have their own source root and scoped output tree, `/docs/?scope=studio&doc=...` is now the explicit Studio docs contract, and `/library/` now hosts the library docs viewer.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/build_docs.rb`
- `assets/js/docs-viewer.js`
- `docs/index.md`
- `library/index.md`
- `_includes/docs_viewer_shell.html`
- `_docs_library_src/library.md`
- `_layouts/default.html`
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)

## [2026-03-30] Added lightweight build-version cache busting to shared shell assets

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Added a lightweight build-version query token to shared shell CSS and JS asset URLs, using the current build timestamp rather than a separate fingerprint pipeline.

**Reason:**  
Local review was vulnerable to stale browser caches after JS/CSS renames or runtime changes, especially while the public search surface was moving and being renamed.

**Effect:**  
Shared shell assets now reload more reliably after a rebuild, the default layout publishes the current asset version in page metadata, and the search runtime can align its own module/data cache busting with that same build token.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `_layouts/default.html`
- `_layouts/work.html`
- `_layouts/work_details.html`
- `_layouts/series.html`
- `_layouts/moment.html`
- `search/index.md`
- `assets/js/search/search-page.js`
- `assets/studio/js/studio-config.js`
- [Site Shell Runtime](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-shell-runtime)

**Notes:**  
This is a pragmatic cache-busting layer for the current static setup. It is not a full hashed-asset pipeline.

## [2026-03-30] Merged moments browsing into the works catalogue

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** works

**Summary:**  
Merged the public moments index UI into the `/series/` works catalogue so one catalogue page now switches between `works` and `moments` with shared view, sort, and pagination controls.

**Reason:**  
The separate moments index duplicated the same catalogue interaction pattern and made the top-level browsing navigation more fragmented than it needed to be.

**Effect:**  
The public top nav now exposes only `works`, `/series/` owns the combined catalogue UI, individual moment pages keep their existing `/moments/<moment_id>/` URLs, and the standalone `/moments/` landing page is no longer published.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `series/index.md`
- `moments/index.md`
- `_layouts/default.html`
- `assets/css/main.css`
- `assets/studio/data/studio_config.json`
- [Data Flow](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=data-flow)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)
- [Site Shell Runtime](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-shell-runtime)

**Notes:**  
The main regression risk is state handling when switching between works and moments modes on the merged catalogue page.

## [2026-03-29] Normalized published site and Studio doc references to docs-viewer links

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Updated published site and Studio docs so references to other published docs now use `/docs/?scope=studio&doc=...` links instead of raw filenames or legacy doc URLs.

**Reason:**  
The docs set is increasingly used through the in-site viewer. Linking published docs through the viewer makes cross-document navigation consistent and keeps repo file references reserved for actual source files and unpublished notes.

**Effect:**  
Published docs now read more cleanly as a connected documentation system, while literal output paths, unpublished docs, and non-doc repo files remain explicit where needed.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- [Site Change Log Guidance](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-change-log-guidance)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)
- [UI Framework](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=ui-framework)
- [CSS Audit Spec](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=css-audit-spec)
- [Studio](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=studio)
- [Tag Editor](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=tag-editor)
- [Series Tags](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=series-tags)

**Notes:**  
This change updates documentation navigation only; it does not change site runtime or pipeline behaviour.

## [2026-03-29] Established a dedicated site-wide change log for non-search history

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Added a dedicated [Site Change Log](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-change-log) plus supporting guidance so meaningful non-search site and Studio changes now have a focused historical record separate from search.

**Reason:**  
Search has become complex enough to justify its own subsystem log. The rest of the site still needs a concise historical record, but should not be mixed into the search log.

**Effect:**  
Future review of non-search development can now happen without reconstructing history from scattered commits or overloading the search change log.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- [Site Change Log](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-change-log)
- [Site Change Log Guidance](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-change-log-guidance)
- `AGENTS.md`

**Notes:**  
This log should be updated for meaningful non-search site, Studio, and pipeline changes as part of normal close-out.

## [2026-03-20] Moved work-detail runtime to per-work JSON and retired the old aggregate work-details flow

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** works

**Summary:**  
Shifted work-detail runtime behaviour so work detail pages resolve from per-work JSON instead of relying on the old aggregate work details index flow.

**Reason:**  
The older aggregate flow added unnecessary coupling and no longer matched the JSON-first direction of the site data model.

**Effect:**  
Work detail runtime became simpler and closer to the canonical per-work data flow. The retired aggregate path and related sitemap/runtime dependencies were removed.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `_layouts/work_details.html`
- `_layouts/work.html`
- `scripts/generate_work_pages.py`
- `scripts/audit_site_consistency.py`
- [Data Flow](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=data-flow)

**Notes:**  
This was part of the wider JSON-first site architecture shift.

## [2026-03-29] Search-specific history moved out of the general site history

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** architecture

**Summary:**  
Confirmed that search history should live in [Search Change Log](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=search-change-log) rather than the broader site log.

**Reason:**  
Search now has its own artifact, UI surface, policy surface, and document set, so combining it with wider site history would make both logs less useful.

**Effect:**  
The site log remains focused on the wider site and non-search Studio development, while search history is reviewed through its own dedicated log.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- [Search Change Log](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=search-change-log)
- [Site Change Log](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-change-log)
- [Site Change Log Guidance](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=site-change-log-guidance)

**Notes:**  
For changes that materially affect both areas, add short entries to both logs.

## [2025-08-19] Adopted JSON-first site data flow for works, series, and moments indexes

**Status:** implemented

**Area:** build pipeline

**Summary:**  
Shifted the main site toward generated JSON artifacts as the primary runtime data layer for works, series, and moments, with lighter collection stubs and index-driven runtime behaviour.

**Reason:**  
The site needed a more consistent and maintainable data flow than page-heavy or mixed-source runtime patterns.

**Effect:**  
The site now relies more heavily on generated JSON contracts and index artifacts, which simplified runtime logic and created a clearer basis for later features such as Studio tooling and search.

**Affected files/docs:**  
- `scripts/generate_work_pages.py`
- `assets/data/works_index.json`
- `assets/data/series_index.json`
- `assets/data/moments_index.json`
- [Data Flow](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=data-flow)
- [Scripts](/docs/?scope=studio&doc=scripts)

**Notes:**  
This entry summarizes the broader architectural shift rather than one single commit.

<pre class="moment-text">
where is the lotus flower?
is it floating in the air
or beneath the surface?
such a heavy weight it carries
all the world’s sufferings
and stories of enlightenment
roots go down into the depths of muddy water
and yet it still knows when to bloom
when the sun comes out
in the night
the lotus sleeps

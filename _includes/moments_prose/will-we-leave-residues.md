<pre class="moment-text">
will we leave residues
like the plants do
tiny particles of soil in water
presence on a little plate
 
will we forget
and others too
our life
when we go
 
what records will we leave
will they be patterns
or just evidence with no meaning
that someone was here
alive and colourful
 
there is mist
it’s not a fog
but it’s purpose is the same
to hide and protect
 
colours are like ghosts
we think they’re real and have substance
like all the things we can touch
 
and so with painting
layers upon layers
always looking for a truth
 
waiting

<pre class="moment-text">
I feel like my heart is broken, and hurts more than a broken bone, but at same time not knowing why or how it happened. the feeling that it’s definately a real thing, but can’t be grasped.
 
a constant slow gradual dissolving that one day just announces, without much warning, ok I’m breaking now, I just thought I’d let you know! and it’s like a question, this strange feeling talking to me: do you accept me for the feeling that I am? what are you going to do?
 
and it presses and presses me to answer. like bubbles from a source deep in the ocean, rising to a surface an unknown distance above, but still rising nonetheless.
 
I can see the bubbles rising and am caught in a loop. where are they going (I know, to the surface an unknown distance above) and can I stop them (should I?) these questions become a kind of paralysis, in which resolving the problem wears me down so much I can’t think anymore.
 
<em>thinking</em> then becomes a painful thing, because I am always thinking, but at same time want to <em>not think</em>. and whilst I’m trying to not think, new moments and feelings and memories are crashing down endlessly, an immense wall of cascading waterfalls.

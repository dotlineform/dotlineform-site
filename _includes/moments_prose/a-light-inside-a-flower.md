<pre class="moment-text">
do the squirrels wonder why
 
the ducks like water?
 
do the birds think
 
why we walk on the ground?
 
the flowers don’t question spring
 
they just have a deep need for sun
 
so that they can fill themselves with colour
 
so it should be with us, naturally
 
all of us carry deep doubts and, sometimes, regrets
 
always questioning
 
is this my true life?
 
is this my true love?
 
we might go round in circles, for ever
 
as if life is a simple roulette table
 
perhaps it is,
 
hundreds of millions of years have passed, after all
 
since we were souls inside single cells
 
floating in the deep sea, drifting with the currents
 
and here we are now
 
life for us is short and fragile
 
so full of wonder
 
there are deeper feelings than those that you once said were deep
 
(but then you changed your mind about them anyway)
 
and floating on the surface seems to me
 
would be wonderful
 
we might float to the surface together

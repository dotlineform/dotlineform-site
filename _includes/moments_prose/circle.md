<pre class="moment-text">
and when we sit in a circle
 
the space in the middle is where all our thoughts and feelings meet
 
and we are comfortable with silence
 
we understand that silence
 
is an inferno of thoughts and feelings
 
see the sparks
 
we can help them
 
with a deep caring and empathy

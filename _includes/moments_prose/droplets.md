<pre class="moment-text">
love flows through our bodies like molten hands
on her skin curves flow in invisible warm lines
i breathe in silky colours of perfume and kisses
her whole body is a blissful smile
 
it isn’t sleep that swallows us
like a bird swooping down to catch prey just below the swelling water
instead we are engulfed in a closeness
feeling that we won’t ever really wake up from our lovely dream
it will bless us because we made it with love
 
looking at people walk past me
they seem to be moving in slow motion, they don’t seem real
my hands are very cold in the rain
my core is still lost in your warmth
glowing coals of closeness touched in our sleepy depths
 
i often cry because it seems so overwhelming
as if nature has so suddenly accepted me into her forest
and all our faults and dreams and desires
none of which i can explain, where do these tears come from?
perhaps they are simply condensation, soul droplets on a window
slowly forming as if from nothing
 
perhaps it’s simply our turn
in amongst all these billions of years in which we find ourselves, now
to enjoy the simple wish we’ve been nurturing in ourselves
which even when we are gone leaves traces of happy memories that will last forever
and give hope to all the doubt that such a thing could even be possible

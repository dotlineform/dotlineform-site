<pre class="moment-text">
how many layers
how many dolls within dolls
how many surfaces
how many words
how much love
is within us?
 
i have looked only a small way inwards
(a few steps down)
and it felt like being lost in depths
of an ocean with no floor
 
just a huge space
with no light
apart from glistening forms
 
and when i come back to the surface
i could not describe to you what i felt
it’s like the embers of a firework
falling from a great height
and disappearing before they reach the ground
 
illusions (if that is what they are)
strange silent symbols
keys

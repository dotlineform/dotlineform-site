<pre class="moment-text">
There is a little man and a little woman. They are holding hands because they love each other.
 
There is a little clear vessel. The vessel is empty and open, and in this space the little man and the little woman contain their love.
 
They live within a circle which encloses their thoughts, although we cannot see this circle, and we cannot see their thoughts.
 
The wish is priceless and cannot be taken out of the little world, it cannot be sold or exchanged. It is unbounded and without substance, it is still and breathing. It lies in here, so that you can touch it.

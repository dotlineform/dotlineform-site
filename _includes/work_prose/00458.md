We can't see through the mist but we can hear rumbling sounds of fog horns - or sirens? - and just as we disappear from view, the voice of a preacher inciting us to give an urgent but undefined commitment

she turns

she encloses what i need to understand

there is a very long way to go inside to see where we have touched, and it starts here

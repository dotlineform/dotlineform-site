<!-- Only needed if you want the catalogue home to have materially different structure from other pages
(e.g., a unique hero, custom sidebar, different header treatment).
Even then, you can still keep it as catalogue/index.md
and simply set layout: catalogue_home in its front matter — optional, not required. -->
